Viola-Jones Implementation-

files:
1. FaceDetection.py 
2. Report.pdf
3. results.json


Folder: Model_Files

strong_classifiers.pkl - linear combination of 1103 weak classifiers
cascade.pkl - cascade model trained from the above strong classifier

Training files- 
1. haar_features.py - For feature extraction
2. threshold_optimization.py - For optimizing thresholds for each feature
3. ada_boost.py - Adaboost implementation
4. cascade_training.py - Cascading the extracted features



Run (training): These files can be used to train the cascade when run in this sequence
1. haar_features.py (first extract "train_posf" and "train_negf")
2. threshold_optimization.py
3. ada_boost.py
4. cascade_training.py 


Run (for detection): Can use already trained cascade for detection purpose
1. FaceDetection.py (run for detection)
